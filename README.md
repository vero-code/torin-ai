# Torin AI

An AI-powered **hiring platform** tackling unemployment and inequality in the IT labor market.  
Instead of filtering candidates by outdated CVs, it evaluates real-world problem-solving, **learning speed**, and adaptability ‚Äî giving self-taught developers, career switchers, and underrepresented talent a fair **chance**.

Working prototype launched at the [**Tech Innovation For Good**](https://devpost.com/software/torin-ai) hackathon, Torin AI is built to create meaningful social impact.

## üéØ The Problem

Traditional hiring filters out brilliant candidates without ‚Äúperfect‚Äù CVs.
-   Self-taught developers, bootcamp grads, and switchers rarely pass initial screenings.
-   Companies waste countless hours on CV-based recruiting, only to discover gaps in practical skills.
-   This fuels inequality and slows innovation.

## üí° Solution

Torin AI shifts the focus from past experience to **future potential**:
-   **Candidates** prove adaptability by solving coding challenges in unfamiliar technologies, guided by an AI assistant.
-   **Employers** access a transparent talent pool, with full visibility into the candidate‚Äôs thought process, learning curve, and problem-solving skills.
-   The result: a fair, objective, and efficient hiring environment.

## üåç Social Impact

-   **Educational equity:** Opens doors for candidates from non-traditional backgrounds.
-   **Economic empowerment:** Creates career opportunities for young professionals worldwide.
-   **Unlocking hidden talent:** Helps companies hire adaptive, future-proof employees who would otherwise be overlooked.
