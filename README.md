# Torin AI

Meaningful social impact app is directly aimed at solving the most acute social problem - unemployment and inequality in the labor market. It helps people who are currently in a vulnerable position (self-taught, switchers, people without experience in top companies) get a fair chance.

This project was launched at **The Tech Innovation For Good Hackathon**, a global event focused on creating solutions with social impact.
